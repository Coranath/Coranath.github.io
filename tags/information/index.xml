      <description>Dragonborn +2 Str, +1 Cha  A Dragonborn Warlock
 As their name implies, dragonborn are of draconic descent and therefore have some side effects of that. These include a breath weapon as well as damage resistance determined by the bloodline from which they’ve come.
A dragonborn would make an excellent Fighter, Sorceror of a draconic bloodline, or perhaps an even better Cleric of the Tempest or War domain!</description>
